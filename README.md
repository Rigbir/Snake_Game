# First Game - Snake

- I wanted to try the SFML library in my work. And also recreate a retro game with updated graphics and custom styles.

- In the Menu you can select the transition to the game;
- Or choose a style of play;
- Also change the gameplay in the Arcade;
- Turn off the game sounds;

- This snake differs from the others for various reasons, the first of them is that not all snakes have such interesting styles. The gameplay is also located in a slot machine, which brings the user back to the old atmosphere of slot machine shops. 

- The project will be supported: patches will be released in which styles/arcades will be added. There are also plans in the future for multiplatform and launching the game on various monitor resolutions.
